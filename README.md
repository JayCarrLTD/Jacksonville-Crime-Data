# PowerBI
The project consists of data pulled from the Jacksonville Crime mapping database. <br>
I used the data provided to graph and map all the reported crime data in the area for January. <br>
I had to clean and manage the data before implementing it into Microsoft Power BI where I generated visiulizations for the data.<br>
The data shows crime trends and outlines crime based on the day, time, and offense type. 
The file is interactive and users can filter by various different criteria.
Download the file and run in Power BI.
