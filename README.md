# PowerBI
The project consists of data pulled from the Jacksonville Crime mapping database. <br>
I used the data provided to graph and map all the reported crime data in the area for January. <br>
I had to clean and manage the data before implementing it into Microsoft Power BI where I generated visiulizations for the data.<br>
The data shows crime trends and outlines crime based on the day, time, and offense type.
